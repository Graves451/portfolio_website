At the heart of this system is the idea of representing each user's musical taste as a high-dimensional embedding ‚Äî a vector that captures the nuances of their top tracks, artists, and genres. Initially, we explored training our own neural network to learn these embeddings, aiming to replicate the kind of semantic richness found in Spotify‚Äôs own recommendation engine. However, this quickly proved to be unfeasible. Training was computationally expensive, and despite experimenting with different architectures and loss functions, we struggled to get accuracy above 70%. We believe this was largely due to limited training data, underpowered infrastructure, and potentially noisy input labels. Given these challenges, we made the decision to use Spotify‚Äôs precomputed audio feature embeddings instead, which gave us reliable, high-quality vectors without the overhead of training from scratch.`,
