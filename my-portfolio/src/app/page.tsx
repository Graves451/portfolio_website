  <h2>Hey - I'm Qiyuan Peng ðŸš€</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a software engineer and a Computer Science & Statistics student at the University of Toronto, with a deep interest in how intelligent systems can be designed to solve real-world problems. Iâ€™m especially fascinated by the blend of algorithmic precision and practical usability â€” building tools that not only work well under the hood but also make peopleâ€™s lives tangibly better.
  </p>
  <p>
    My projects have spanned everything from music taste matching using neural embeddings, to AI-driven study tools that adapt to user needs, to gamified platforms that make learning and debating more engaging. Across all of them, one theme remains: I care deeply about crafting systems that feel thoughtful, efficient, and intuitive â€” systems that donâ€™t just function, but resonate.
  </p>
  <p>
    During my recent internship at Kaboo Financial, I worked alongside experienced engineers to improve infrastructure, streamline testing workflows, and refine backend performance. I learned the value of scalable architecture and clean design in high-stakes environments, and discovered that I love contributing to teams where ideas move fast and every commit counts. Whether it's designing robust data schemas or tracking down edge-case bugs, I find a lot of satisfaction in the details.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm particularly drawn to work at the intersection of machine learning, personalization, and humanâ€“computer interaction â€” places where algorithms meet behavior, and where code can shape experiences in subtle, powerful ways. I thrive in roles where there's space to think deeply, collaborate openly, and build things that challenge the status quo.
  </p>
  <p>
    When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m usually breaking down how AI could change strategy games, reading up on game theory, or experimenting with new datasets for fun. I see tech not just as a job, but as a craft â€” one that rewards curiosity, clarity, and relentless iteration.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're working on something ambitious â€” whether itâ€™s a product, a research idea, or an experimental concept that doesnâ€™t quite fit the mold â€” Iâ€™d love to connect.
